# Blasteroids
A fan game tribute to the popular video game of 1980s - Blasteroids. The player controls a spaceship (with 3 lives) lost in the cold space and the spaceship is constantly bombarded with asteroids. The spaceship is equipped with a cannon, which can be used to destoy asteroids. Every time an asteroid is hit by a blast fired from the cannon, the player's score increases by 100. If the spaceship is hit with an asteroid, it loses 1 life, player beware! Upon collision of the spaceship or blast with the asteroid, a big asteroid is split into a few smaller ones and a small asteroid disappears. The aim is to fly around, survive and destroy as many asteroids as possible. Good luck!    

## Prerequisites
The game uses Allegro library v.5 (an open source game development library) which can be installed from https://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/
